										<h2>Vaporwave’s Appropriation and Appreciation of Japanese Culture</h2>

								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/51948557723_6b5bb8c4a5_b.jpg" alt="" /></span><p style="margin-left: 25px";>Vaporwave is a microgenre of art where aesthetics of different eras - typically the 80s
and early 90s - are arranged in a surrealist, dreamlike hodge-podge to evoke strong emotions
such as nostalgia. In music, companies such as Isotope have constructed software options to
adapt vinyl crackles and cassette tape hissing that were - at a time - compulsory to consuming
music for modern music producers. Trademarked 80s synths such as the Arturia Juno-6 have
been issued in digital plugins. In visual media, video in the 2010s reprioritized the graininess
and fuzziness of VHS television over full definition clarity. Sourced from "The Appropriating
Subject", Jana Cattien and Richard John Stopford define cultural appropriation as "if one uses
or takes ‘other’ cultural material," (Cattien and Stopford, 2018). Yet, they also describe
cultural appreciation as one that "merely acts as an audience" of another's culture instead
(Cattien and Stopford, 2018) Though blatantly appropriative, I argue that Japan's inspirations
of vaporwave are more appreciative to the nation's culture than exploitative of it as they are
initially based in Western ideals to begin with.</p>
                                <p style="margin-left: 25px";>A strong cultural reference point of vaporwave is Japan. Furthermore, Ken Macleod's
"Vaporwave: Politics, Protest, and Identity" argues that Japan itself can be "viewed as the
national equivalent of vaporwave" (Macleod, 2018). What validates the dual appropriation
and appreciation of vaporwave is that the genre reflects the post-Cold War techno-economic
expansion in 1980s Japan. In fact, Japan's economic boom bled into their consumerist culture
shock of the 1990s. They became recognized as the country that developed upon technologies
first birthed in the Western world in a way that made them uniquely Japanese; these
technologies including cars, computers, television, video games, and - most pertinently to
vaporwave's sound - musical instruments.</p>
                                <p style="margin-left: 25px";>Sampling as a musical technique is innately appropriative, as one is literally
recontextualizing slices of music from another's culture. Musically, vaporwave elements can
retrospectively be seen in plunderphonics artists like The Avalanches and The Books; who
would similarly combine music and television samples in a garish, yet evocative manner
distinct from the groove orientation of hip-hop. They are also observed in Devon Hendryx
(later-JPEGMAFIA)'s work from 2007-2009, with the pitch manipulation of 80s pop hits
from Angela Bofill among other artists.</p>
                                <p style="margin-left: 25px";>According to Andrew Wheelan and Raphael Nowak's "'Vaporwave Is (Not) A
Critique Of Capitalism'" essay, the genre was officially recognized titularly with several
albums between 2010 and 2011 released by Daniel Lopatin (under his alias Chuck Person),
James Ferraro, and Vektroid (under her alias Macintosh Plus). Most vaporwave artists elect to
work under pseudonyms. The chosen anonymity allows for exploration - and thus
appreciation - of the cold, dystopic, corporate themes critiqued in the genre with chosen
names such as Saint Pepsi and Sweetheart's Paradise Ltd. While vaporwave artists initially
operated from a pure appreciation of the sounds they tampered with, the oversaturation of the
online community allows for trendy appropriation of the genre, much in the consumerist
manner primordial creators critiqued.</p>
                                <p style="margin-left: 25px";>Macintosh Plus' 2011 album Floral Shoppe has become historically iconic for its
cover debuting vaporwave's visual aesthetics. The cover features a Roman head atop a
checkered board and a pixelated photo of a city skyline on a bright pink background. The
design mimicks "1990s Japanese websites characterized by bright colours and ‘busy’ text"
(Glitsos, 2015), but the Roman head remains anachronistic to the composition as is the style
of vaporwave. The ubiquitous traces of Japanese characters and words in vaporwave
iconography have also stemmed from Floral Shoppe's bright blue title being typed in
Japanese on its cover.</p>
                                <p style="margin-left: 25px";>Further, much of the vaporwave visuals - as seen in various YouTube compilations of
the music - are owed to Japanese influence. In one video, a song can be soundtracking
footage of 1980s video games made by Japanese company Sega. Alternatively, videos
occasionally adapt the contemporary anime art style. Montages of Japanese commercials
from the period will also run alongside the music, and stills of female Japanese models from
period commercials of the period will grace album covers and video thumbnails. As seen in
1990s advertising, the Japanese based their then-futurist perspective on North American
consumer ideals, until their economic recession in the 2000s. In essence, vaporwave is the
West's nostalgic view of Japan's idealistic view of the West's future.</p>
                                <p style="margin-left: 25px";>Finley Michaels (who works under her aforementioned alias Sweetheart’s Paradise
Ltd.) describes the modern oversaturation of vaporwave as "a result of hauntology;" a
concept proposed by Jacques Derrida in 1933 (Cattien and Stopford, 2018). The etymology
of the word breaks down as a "haunting of the past", and as such, vaporwave works through
defining nostalgic reverberations within the present. These euphoric cadences and pillowy
instrument loops aren't without appropriative creation, but through global circulation online,
they also contain space for appreciative consumption too.</p>
