								<h2>Hello!</h2>
                                <p>My name is Matthew Sonne and I am quite unconfident in calling myself a <em>professional writer</em> or content creator. If anything, I feel more akin to a full-time documentarian of thoughts and feelings, frequently about music, art, and the creative process(es) behind them. One of my mediums for such documentation is writing, and that can constitute blogposts, transcribed conversations and interviews, and/or other personal work.<br>I grew up as a voracious reader, a tenacious writer, and most importantly, a highly observant person. The catch is, I wasn't noticing what everyone else was, or catching everything at their speed, or even was aware how much my own interests led me away from theirs. Ultimately, <em>neurodivergency</em> made me aware of how isolating my manners of communicating with the world often felt, so I didn't see many options but to cultivate the best possible understanding with myself as a refuge.<br> I know what I know best, and I feel that I know <em>music</em> best; from joining elementary school choirs, to taking up instruments in extra-curricular groups, to producing my own music, to experiencing concerts, to assisting artists' projects such as playing rock bass for rapper Vile Murk. In addition, my other auditory passion is podcasting, similarly more on the technical side than in front of the microphone. I have experience editing a 15-minute podcast on authenticity and identity out a 30-minute conversation. I create and document to make sure I keep hold of observations, thoughts, and valuable information.</p>

								<p style="margin-left: 25px";> Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25th, 1938 in Los Angeles,
California. James was raised by her 14-year-old, sexually active mother Dorothy Hawkins.
Though her father's identity is unknown, she suspects him to be pool player Minnesota
Fats, due to several features she had in her mixed appearance. She was raised for a time
by her mother Dorothy's friends, Lulu and James Rogers.
She sang gospel spirituals at the age of 5 outside of school in church, but she liked
music outside gospel. Her diverse palette would show up in her penchant for switching
sounds and genres throughout her career. Her signature huge voice came from her
experience in the St. Paul's Baptist Church, being punched in the chest by the choirmaster
to get her to sing from the gut. After Lulu died, Etta and Dorothy moved from LA to San
Francisco and she refused to sing for a time, choosing to play bass fiddle in the school
orchestra instead.
Losing a parental figure and with a single parent in their 20s at the time of her adolescence,
James became a delinquent. She got into fights outside school, largely ignored her studies,
and formed a street corner girl group called the Creolettes with two girls - one of which being. Jean Mitchell - that later became the "Peaches" of Etta James and the Peaches.</p>

										<p>An Academic Essay</p>
									</div>
									<div class="meta">
										<time class="published" datetime="2022-04-22">April 22, 2022</time>
										<a class="author"><span class="name">Matthew Sonne</span><img src="images/375527989_3592757834327360_5270199017023942372_n.jpg" atype="image/jpg"></a>

								<p style="margin-left: 25px";> Vaporwave is a microgenre of art where aesthetics of different eras - typically the 80s
and early 90s - are arranged in a surrealist, dreamlike hodge-podge to evoke strong emotions
such as nostalgia. In music, companies such as Isotope have constructed software options to
adapt vinyl crackles and cassette tape hissing that were - at a time - compulsory to consuming
music for modern music producers. Trademarked 80s synths such as the Arturia Juno-6 have
been issued in digital plugins. In visual media, video in the 2010s reprioritized the graininess
and fuzziness of VHS television over full definition clarity. Sourced from "The Appropriating
Subject", Jana Cattien and Richard John Stopford define cultural appropriation as "if one uses
or takes ‘other’ cultural material," (Cattien and Stopford, 2018). Yet, they also describe
cultural appreciation as one that "merely acts as an audience" of another's culture instead
(Cattien and Stopford, 2018) Though blatantly appropriative, I argue that Japan's inspirations
of vaporwave are more appreciative to the nation's culture than exploitative of it as they are
initially based in Western ideals to begin with.</p>

She and her band await to take the stage in the building's newly added corridor and green room; generated from recently purchased space.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 25px";>Encircled by warping guitar samples and whirring synth drones, Ethereal's first lyrics "My body has forgotten what it's like to be here," echo against the walls of her stage side green room. Toussaint’s spoken words rattle the snare of seasoned drummer Yoshito “Yoshi” Ono's Yamaha kit from the subwoofers under the stage floorboards.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 25px";>The young adults all across the club erupt in a sudden roar, charged in energy from bar beverages. The elders clap politely, Tamara's mother chief amongst them. The projector curtaining the band slowly rises, and Toussaint leads them out to the audience. Dante Hayes plucks the opening notes of album cut "Under Pressure" on his seafoam green Fender jazz bass and rarely stops, aside from emploring crowd participation with clapping.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 25px";>All four members spent three months jamming in collaborator Alex Sadowski’s condo’s basement, converting songs permeated by electronics into riffs and parts, and turning those into muscle memory. With four crashes of the hi-hat, Toussaint firmly grasps the microphone and breathes deeply, ready to find out what she remembers about performing live.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 25px";>In the nine months from starting work on her EP Ethereal in December 2022 to the show coronating its release, Toussaint has oscillated between meeting commercial demands for a modern independent artist, and keeping her art honest and natural.</p>
